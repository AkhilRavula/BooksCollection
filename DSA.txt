Arrays :
imp topics to check 
1.
=>two pointer technique 
   i & j => i for traversing & j for last zero index
   
   if(x[i]!=0)
    { swap x[i],x[j]
	 J++;
	 }
	 
=>Find pairs of numbers of x sum 

2.Subsequenc => use recursion approach
 Look at nbits problem 

3.need to learn quick sort /Merge sort from here

4.Sort 0,1,2
  3 pointer technique using low mid high = 0 ;

Trees :

N nodes tree will have n-1 edges

Trees Traversal =>
 Inorder => In(middle so root is middle)
   Left root right
 Preorder=>rooot left right
 Postoirder=>left right root
