Sql interview 

Primary key vs Unique key 
primary key is not null vs can be null

1 per table (or combination) vs many unique keys


char - fixed length  varchar- variable length (depending on data size it will adjust)

Index -Increase search performance 

clustered vs non-clustered Indexs

Window sql functions 

rank skips next rank ,if rank is common ,dense_rank wont skip 

cross join - cartesian product 

clustered vs non-clustered
 1.Determines the order in which data will be stored in the table 
 2.cluster index is faster 
 
 sql performance tuning 
 
 1.sql profiler 
 2.extended events under management 
 3.Query Store
 
 
 Table Scan-without PK or clustered index ,Index Scan with index without where clause,Index Seek with where clause
 
 Sqlserver physically stores data in the form of datapages .
 
 we read execution plans from right to left & top to bottom .
 
 keylookup & rid lookup=> learn from Kudvenkat videos
 
 
 
 Why Views :
  1.Hides complexity 
  2.Secuirty Mechanism 
  3.Simply supporting legacy code 
  


ACID Properties for a transcation:

Atomicity =>Either all or None
Consistency =>The total amount before and after the transaction must be maintained. 
Isolation => This property ensures that multiple transactions can occur concurrently 
             without leading to the inconsistency of the database state.
Durability => updates /insert sud be permanent


sql proc performance tips:
Include the schema name when calling a database object.=>Use Fully Qualified Name like dbo.procname
SET NOCOUNT ON
Avoid Cursors ,Use set based queries wherever possible means joins
have proper indexes
Use joins instead of correlated subqueries.

SQL Server provides various tools and features for 
performance tuning, such as SQL Server Profiler, Extended Events, and Query Store. 


--OFFSET & FETCH
select  amount_paid from fee order by amount_paid desc OFFSET 2 ROWS FETCH NEXT 1 ROWS ONLY;


SELECT *,DENSE_RANK() OVER(ORDER BY AMOUNT_PAID desc) AS ranks from fee order by amount_paid desc;




Javascript :

Undefined : Variable declared ,but value is unassigned 
Null : Datatype & indicates intentional absence of data 

Hoisting : Mechanism of moving variable declaration / functions to top of the scope .
 Var variables are hoisted and undefined value is assigned 
 Let variables are also hoisted but value isnt assigned & throws error 

If we create a variable without var keyword it will become global & available to all functions .(Even when it is inside a function)

closures- are functions inside a function which makes state stateful 

 => need to use self-invoking function inside it another function ;
  example :
      const add = (function(){
	  let counter = 0;
	  return function(){counter=counter+1; return counter;}
	  })();
	  add();


Scopes :
  Block scope - within block let is only accessible /outside block var is accessible .example if loop etc..
     Variables declared with the var keyword can NOT have block scope.
  Function scope - var let const within function
  Global scope - var /let const at top or variable without type
  
  
Promises => to manage async data & manage call back functions .
  
  
  let countValue = new Promise(function (resolve, reject) {
  resolve("Promise resolved");
});

// executes when promise is resolved successfully

countValue
  .then(function successValue(result) {
    console.log(result);
  })

  .then(function successValue1() {
    console.log("You can call multiple functions this way.");
});
